"I'm cool with 1-2... I think coach made some errors personnel wise but he's still learning. What I can confidently say, is that we played hard on both end despite some miscues. Would you have thought we'd lose to the C's by 2 at the beginning of the game?.....NO #knicks"
@alanhahn Hey its the truth but honestly all we can ask for is to see this consitsnt effort. Wins will come even if they are minimal this year. Its all for the new culture right now. #knicks #retroknicks
@masterluke76 Morning... Partner in Ballin!!! LET'S GET THAT W... GO #KNICKS!
ISO wit da CHEESEcake  #Knicks #NewYorkForever
The #Knicks have been getting out in transition and running the ball up the floor like bandits. @harleygeffner on how pushing the ball immediately after a defensive rebound is a great way for the Fizdale's guys to keep that up:
The #Knicks have more wins than the #Thunder 
Theyve done a great job of making me feel like Im welcome here. They treat me like Im one of their picks. They say theyre very excited about the future and having me right now.
Really sucked to see @KevKnox go down with that ankle sprain but on the positive side I like what I'm seeing from the young man hopefully he won't be out too long get well soon @nyknicks #Knicks #KnicksTape #KnicksNation #NYKnicks #NYK
