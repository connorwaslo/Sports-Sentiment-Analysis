Celtics vs 76ers is going to be a fun game. Things to look out for:

Has Simmons improved his jump shot at all? Look for defenders to sag off and dare him to shoot 15 footers. 

Are Kyrie and Hayward 100%?

People are making a big deal about the minutes situation with #CUsRise #Celtics being stacked. How the fck has the Warriors (a fellow stacked team) been thriving ? They all just play as a team for the ring. Its not a conflict or rocket science.

Is #Sixers #Celtics a rivalry?

JJ Redick says NO

Its not a rivalry until we knock them out of the playoffs. For now theyve got the upper hand. Its not a rivalry

Celtics were 7-2 vs Sixers last season and Sixers have lost 9 straight in Boston
